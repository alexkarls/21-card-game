# 21 Card Game

## NOTE TO EXAMINER

I want to mention that in a previous course (1DV607 - Object Oriented Analysis and Design Using UML) we worked with a BlackJack implementation.
As BlackJack is similar to 21 there may be similarities in some part of the code, if so this would be unintentional.

As stated, I wanted to mention and be clear about the above.

# Instructions

[Link to download JDK (AdoptOpenJDK)](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

This method should also work: ["Import a project..."](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/import-project-or-module-wizard.html) to import the "code" (project) folder.
Note that Maven should be selected in the dropdown "Import project from external model".
